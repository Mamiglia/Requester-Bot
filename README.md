# Requester-Bot
Use for Telegram bots only  
-
This bot let users to do requests to the admins of a channel  

FEATURES (not bugs): 
-  
>This bot is not a simple do-a-request bot, it allows admins to refuse, accept or vote a request by users  
Wait, What?  
When a User do a request the bot sends the message to the staff group and then the admins can decide:  
-Refusing the request (maybe is too stupid, or whatever)  
-Accepting a Request (maybe is really an intelligent request)  
-Send the request to the public group of your channel, so the request will be voted by users  

>Complete (and quite simple) customization all the fields that have a '$' in them have to be customized (See definitions.md to learn more)  
>Up to 2 different type of request  
>Bugfree (AT THE MOMENT)  
>Not a heavy bot  


This is not only the first bot in Python I do, it's also the first working, complex and totally new code that i write in Python, so it's my first work at all in the programming world  
Said that I deeply apologize for all the horrible mistakes that I could do in this bot, for the bad translations, and the amount of meaningless names of definitions  

Obviously I have to thanks all the fantastic people that helped me: starting from @matteb99, @fef0h, @pietroalbini (for his fantastic Botogram), codacademy and last but not least @frank1907 for making me curious about coding world   

builded with Botogram (https://github.com/pietroalbini/botogram)
