# Requester-Bot
Use for Telegram bots only  
-
This bot lets users to do requests to the admins of a channel  

FEATURES (not bugs): 
-  
>This bot is not a common make-a-request bot, it allows admins to refuse, accept or vote a request by users  
Wait, What?  
When a User does a request the bot sends the message to the staff group and then the admins can decide:  
-Refusing the request (maybe is too stupid, or whatever)  
-Accepting a Request (maybe is really an intelligent request)  
-Send the request to the public group of your channel, so the request will be voted by users  

>Complete (and quite simple) customization: all the fields that have a '$' in them have to be customized (See Definitions.md to learn more)  

>Up to 2 different type of requests  

>Bugfree (AT THE MOMENT)  

>Not an heavy bot  


This is the first bot in Python I do and furthermore it's also the first working, complex and totally new code that i write in Python, so it's my first work at all in the programming world  
Now, that you are aware of the fact that I'm a noob, I deeply apologize for all the horrible mistakes that I could do in this bot, for the bad translations, and the amount of meaningless names of definitions  

Of course I have to thank all the fantastic people that helped me: starting from @matteb99, @fef0h, @Frank1907, @pietroalbini (for his fantastic Botogram), codacademy, and last but not least Francesco Palmas for the emotional assistance   

built with Botogram (https://github.com/pietroalbini/botogram)  

Tell me about any issue, because i'm a noob and i need critics to grow up
